# this file randomly guesses a pose as a transformation matrix
# the orienation is not random, only a random guess between 8 selected poses which are the most viable when picking up cubes
# the x y and z are random within the robots reach limitations

# The pose_guess method is a technique used to generate random initial poses for inverse kinematics calculations.
# By randomly selecting points within a semi-sphere and assigning orientations from a predefined set of matrices,
# this method provides diverse initial guesses for the end-effectorâ€™s position and orientation.
# The generated pose is represented as a 4x4 transformation matrix, ensuring that the initial guess falls within
# the specified constraints. This method is essential for initializing iterative optimization algorithms
# in achieving the desired end-effector pose.
