# This script is designed to interact with a robotic arm using the Kortex API. It retrieves the current joint angles
# and pose of the arm, and computes the forward kinematics.
#
# Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of the key parts of the code:
#
# rot2eul_zyx(R): This function converts a rotation matrix R into Euler angles using the ZYX convention.
# It first checks if the input is a valid 3x3 rotation matrix. Then, it extracts the three Euler angles and
# returns them in degrees.
# get_angles_pose(base): This function tries to get the current joint angles of the arm and compute the forward
# kinematics. It enters a loop where it attempts these operations until successful. If an operation fails,
# it prints an error message and tries again in the next iteration. Once both operations are successful,
# it breaks out of the loop and returns the joint angles and pose.
# main(): This is the main function of the script. It sets up the connection to the device, creates the
# required services, and then calls get_angles_pose(base) to get the joint angles and pose of the arm.
# It also prints the measured Cartesian pose of the arm.
# This script provides a way to interact with a robotic arm at a low level, allowing you to retrieve
# detailed information about its current state.
